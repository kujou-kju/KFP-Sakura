# Kujou's Sakura Trees and Wood
### Resource Pack for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16-1.19

A Resource Pack which turns eighter [Acacia or Birch Trees](README.md#so-what-are-the-birch-and-acacia-variants-now) into Cherry Blossom Trees.
Former known as the Sakura Trees and Wood Addon for my discontinued KFP-Pack.

> ⚠️ [Optifine](https://optifine.net/download) is required to run this pack properly, running the pack without will result in a limited experience.

## 2023 Rework - what will happen and will be there something different?
As of december of 2022 I decited to make a rework but due to my work on the german translations for [Enka.Network](https://enka.cc) and [Collapse Launcher](https://github.com/neon-nyan/Collapse), my (probably) upcoming revival of my [graphic design activities](https://twitter.com/kujoudzn/status/1656257255027757056?s=20) and personal circumstances in general the last few months I wasn't able to do it.
Also I'm planning to get somehow a compatibillity with fabric since I'm currently using fabric with sodium etc over the classic forge/optifine way (optifabric isn't an option for me it sucks). Things will get done sometime in june.

This Pack will not get updated for any Minecraft Version beyond 1.19 because of the introduction of the [Cherry Blossom Biome](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/cherry-blossom-biome-coming-minecraft-120) in the upcoming 1.20 release.

## But what exactly does this Pack now?
* It uses a custom colormap to change the birch or acacia leafes (depends on your Choice - more infos below)
* It replaces birch logs with acacia ones using a custom model (if you choose the birch variant)

This Pack doesn't change the Birch-based Items (anymore - as of the remake) since it would change the look of birch made structures which may not everyone wants. This was previously the case.

## So what are the birch and acacia variants now? (planned)
As of the revival in [june 2023](README.md#2023-rework---what-will-happen-and-will-be-there-something-different) I'll provide two versions of the zip files. Back when this Pack was an Addon for the KFP-Pack it changed birch trees and I'm sure that many player (still) uses this pack for that purpose. But since I started a little project with friends back in october 2022 I've got the Idea to use acacia instead so thats why there will be two variants now.

**Make sure to select the right variant for you for your Minecraft version - especially if you're using the CurseForge Launcher** since it will automatically pick one of the variants if not choosen (but idk which one it will be).

## Where can I download it?
You can find the newest Releases and pre-releases on [CurseForge](https://github.com/KiaraFriedPhoenix/KFP-Sakura/releases/latest)
