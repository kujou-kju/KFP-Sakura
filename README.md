# Kujou's Sakura Trees and Wood
### Resource Pack for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16 and newer

A Resource Pack which turns eighter [Acacia or Birch Trees](README.md#so-what-are-the-birch-and-acacia-variants-now) into Cherry Blossom Trees.
Former known as the Sakura Trees and Wood Addon for my discontinued KFP-Pack.

> ⚠️ [Optifine](https://optifine.net/download) is required to run this pack properly, running the pack without will result in a limited experience.

## But what exactly does this Pack now?
* It uses a custom colormap to change the birch or acacia leafes (depends on your Choice - more infos below)
* It replaces birch logs with acacia ones using a custom model (if you choose the birch variant)

This Pack doesn't change the Birch-based Items (anymore - as of the remake) since it would change the look of birch made structures which may not everyone wants. This was previously the case.

## So what are the birch and acacia variants now?
Since the revival in december 2022 I provide you two versions of the zip files. Back when this Pack was an Addon for the KFP-Pack it changed birch trees and I'm sure that many player (still) uses this pack for that purpose. But since I started a little project with friends I've got the Idea to use acacia instead so thats why there are two variants now.

**Make sure to select the right variant for you for your Minecraft version - especially if you're using the CurseForge Launcher** since it will automatically pick one of the variants if not choosen (but idk which one it will be).

## Where can I download it?
You can find the newest Releases and pre-releases on [CurseForge](https://github.com/KiaraFriedPhoenix/KFP-Sakura/releases/latest)
