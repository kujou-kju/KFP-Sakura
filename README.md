An Addon for the KFP Pack* which turns birch Trees into Cherry Blossom Trees

> ⚠️ Optifine is recommended to run this pack properly, running the pack without will result in a limited experience. Download it from [here](https://optifine.net/download)

`*` Basically it does work with every other Pack and Vanilla aswell as long as you have Optifine installed but this Pack was created for the [KFP-Pack](https://github.com/KiaraFriedPhoenix/KFP-Pack)

## What this pack changes
* Recolors* the Birch Leaves and renames them**
* Recolors Birch Logs and renames them
* Recolors Birch Wood and most craftable Items

`*` This Pack uses a Colormap so this Addon doesn't need to overwrite textures so you can use this Pack with every Resource Pack you like.

`**` This Pack does rename the changed Blocks and Items (only german, en-us and en-gb supported rn, othe rlanguages will still show the items as birch ones)
